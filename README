Build instructions/development workflow:

First, install the live-build package on the debian system you will be using:
sudo apt-get install live-build

To build the ISO, run in this directory:
sudo lb build

To test it, if you have qemu-kvm installed:
kvm -cdrom binary-hybrid.iso -m 1024

IMPORTANT: If you make changes, make sure to clean before rebuilding:
* hack hack *
sudo lb clean
sudo lb build

If "lb clean" isn't run first, changes may not be applied.

Interesting files:
config/package-lists/concerto.list
    names the packages to be added to the base Debian system

config/includes.chroot/usr/local/bin/concerto
    acts as an X session script to run chromium in fullscreen kiosk mode

config/includes.chroot/lib/live/config/050-concerto-xsession-manager
    runs at boot time and sets up /usr/local/bin/concerto as the default X
    session manager
